   E               B              Dbm
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
A                   E  B
It don't matter, anyhow
       E               B              Dbm
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Gb7                   B  B7
If you don't know by now
          E                    E7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
A                        Gb7
Look out your window and I'll be gone
E          B          Dbm        A
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
E           B               E   B
Don't think twice, it's all right


   E               B               Dbm
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
A                  E     B
That light I never knowed
       E               B               Dbm
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
Gb7                          B   B7
I'm on the dark side of the road
        E                                  E7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
A                            Gb7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
E        B            Dbm         A
We never did too much talkin' anyway
E              B               E    B
So don't think twice, it's all right


   E               B              Dbm
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
A                    E   B
Like you never did before
   E               B              Dbm
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Gb7                   B  B7
I can't hear you any more
      E                                E7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
A                       Gb7
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
E             B             Dbm        A
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
E               B               E   B
But don't think twice, it's all right


    E                 B              Dbm
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
          A              E   B
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    E         B          Dbm
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
Gb7                         B  B7
So I'll just say fare thee well
        E                  E7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    A                      Gb7
You could have done better but I don't mind
E        B            Dbm          A
You just kinda wasted my precious time
E               B               E
But don't think twice, it's all right
