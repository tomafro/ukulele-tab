Intro: Gb Bbm Ebm B

Verse:
       Gb      Bbm        Ebm     B
Oh the bitter winds are coming in
    Gb    Bbm                Ebm     B
And I'm already missing the summer
Gb           Bbm       Ebm        B
Stockholm's cold but I've been told
      Gb       Bbm                  Ebm    B
I was born to endure this kind of weather
     Gb          Bbm          Ebm          B
When it's you I find like a ghost in my mind
     Gb               Bbm             Db
I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown

Chorus:
Gb                       B
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
   Ebm                      Db
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
Gb                 B
No, I'm not asking much of you
     Ebm          Db                  Gb
Just sing little darling, sing with me

Verse:
Gb             Bbm        Ebm                 B
Now so much I know that things just don't grow
       Gb     Bbm                     Ebm     B
If you don't blessed them with your patience
Gb             Bbm             Ebm          B
And I've been there before I held up the door
     Gb    Bbm              Ebm    B
For every stranger with a promise
        Gb       Bbm               Ebm              B
But I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
     Gb        Bbm                   Ebm    B
Every morning keeps returning at my window
       Gb            Bbm        Ebm              B
And it brings me to you and I won't just pass through
Gb           Bbm           Db
But I'm not asking for a storm

Chorus:
Gb                       B
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
   Ebm                      Db
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
Gb                 B
No, I'm not asking much of you
     Ebm          Db                  Gb
Just sing little darling, sing with me

Bridge:
Ebm        Bbm         B       Gb
And yes I might have lied to you
Ebm        Bbm              B              Gb
You wouldn't benefit from knowing of the truth
Ebm    Bbm            B       Gb
I was frightened but I held fast
Ebm    Bbm   B        Gb
I need you now at long last

Chorus -x2-:
Gb                       B
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
   Ebm                      Db
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
Gb                 B
No, I'm not asking much of you
     Ebm          Db                  Gb
Just sing little darling, sing with me
