Verse:
F                 Am
Turn down the lights;
Am                    F
Turn down the bed.
F                     C
Turn down these voices
Am                 Dm
Inside my head.

F                     Am
Lay down with me;
Am                 F
Tell me no lies.
  F                  C
Just hold me close;
Am                 Dm
Don't patronize.

Dm                    Gsus4   G
Don't patronize me.

Chorus:
                       F                 C
Cause I can't make you love me
    Dm
If you don't.
                F                  C
You can't make your heart feel
  Am                  Am  G
Something it won't.
Am              F
Here in the dark
     G               Am
In these final hours,
    Am                     F
I will lay down my heart
 G                       Am
And I'll feel the power;
              Dm
But you don't.
               G
No, you don't.
                       F              C
Cause I can't make you love me
            Dm
If you don't.

Verse:
F                  Am
I'll close my eyes,
Am                  F
Then I won't see
F                    C
The love you don't feel
Am                G
When you're holding me.

F                  Am
Morning will come,
Am                        F
And I'll do what's right;
F                        C
Just give me till then
Am                   G
To give up this fight.

Dm                              G
And I will give up this fight.

Cause I can't make you love me
    Dm
If you don't.
                F                  C
You can't make your heart feel
  Am                  Am  G
Something it won't.
Am              F
Here in the dark
     G               Am
In these final hours,
    Am                     F
I will lay down my heart
 G                       Am
And I'll feel the power;
              Dm
But you don't.
               G
No, you don't.
                       F              C
Cause I can't make you love me
            Dm
If you don't.
            F
If you don't.
