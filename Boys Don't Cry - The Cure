Verse:
   A               Bm
 I would say I'm sorry
        Dbm                      D
  If I thought that it would change your mind
  A                 Bm
 But I know that this time
         Dbm                   D
 I have said too much, been too unkind

Pre-Chorus:
Dbm         Bm             Dbm                      Bm
 I try to laugh about it cover it all up with lies
Dbm         Bm             Dbm                        Bm
 I try to laugh about it hiding the tears in my eyes

 'Cause boys don't cry
    A   Bm   Dbm  D -D- -Dbm- -Bm-
 Boys don't cry

Verse:
   A                  Bm
 I would break down at your feet
     Dbm                 D
 And beg forgiveness plead with you
  A                      Bm
 But I know that it's too late
     Dbm                    D
 And now there's nothing I can do

Verse:
   A                 Bm
 I would tell you that I loved you
Dbm                   D
 If I thought that you would stay
  A                Bm
 But I know that it's no use
        Dbm             D
 That you've already gone away

Bridge:
E                 Gbm7
 Misjudged your limits
E                 Gbm7
 Pushed you too far
E                 Gbm7
 Took you for granted
E
 I thought that you needed me more

Verse:
      A                Bm
 Now I would do most anything
    Dbm                    D
 To get you back by my side
  A           Bm
 But I just keep on laughing
 Dbm                        D
 Hiding the tears in my eyes

Chorus:
          A           Bm  Dbm  D -D- -Dbm- -Bm-
