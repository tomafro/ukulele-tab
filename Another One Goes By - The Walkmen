Intro: Eb Gm Fm Bb

Verse: Eb Gm Fm Bb

Is your skin your skeletons
Splinters my daydreams
Under surface see is it any seed
Shadows fly across the wall
I walk outside and try to see you right in front of me
Silhouette of something sweet and so bright

Chorus: Bb Dm Cm F

Don't know what to offer you I'm only broke and lonely
And another one goes, and another goes by
Sometimes when I step outside I see you standing right in front of me
And another one goes, and another one goes by

Bridge/Solo: Eb Gm Fm Bb

Chorus: Bb Dm Cm F

Don't know what to offer you
I'm only broke and lonely
And another one goes, and another one goes by
Sometimes when I walk outside I see it right in front of me and so bright
And another one goes
And another one goes
And another one goes
By
