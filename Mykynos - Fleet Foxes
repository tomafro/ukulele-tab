The door slam loud and rows up a cloud of dust on us
 Dbm         B     A               B  A   Abm         A
Footsteps follow, down through the hollow sound, torn up


    Gbm                Dbm
And you will go to Mykonos
       Abm                Dbm
With a vision of a gentle coast
      Gbm               Dbm
And a sun to maybe dissipate
    Ab                   A   B
Shadows of the mess you made

How did any holes in the snow tipped pines, I find
Dbm        B        A           B        A   B  Dbm
Hatching from the seed of your thin mind, all night?
